## Problems we encountered

### Time management

The things we weren't able to finish at school had to be done at home.

### Finding an idea

It turned out to be quite difficult to find an idea we all could work on. We solved this by combining different aspects of ideas we had before.

### Coding in a group

It was hard to split up the work for 3 people. Communication was key.
